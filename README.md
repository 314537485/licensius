Tiny License Framework for Java
=====================
[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/decebals/licensius.png)](https://travis-ci.org/decebals/licensius)
[![Maven Central](http://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/ro.fortsoft.licensius/licensius.svg)](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|ro.fortsoft.licensius)

It's an open source (Apache license) tiny (only 14KB) license framework in Java, with zero dependencies and a quick learning curve.

How to use
-------------------
```java
LicenseManager licenseManager = LicenseManager.getInstance();
License license = licenseManager.getLicense();
licenseManager.isValidLicense(license);
```

In `private.key` file exists the private key used to create the license.  
In `public.key` file exists the public key used to validate the license.  
The public key (public.key) is delivered with your application jar.  

To create a new license, you must create a template file (`template.dat`) that contains all license's components
and to run `LicenseTool`.  
If the private key or the public key doesn't exists then licensius will create these files for you. The license will
be a `license.dat` file.  

By default Licensius using DSA algorithm (the key length in bits is 1024) for generating keys (private and public).

Licensius uses `X509EncodedKeySpec` to encode the public key and `PKCS8EncodedKeySpec` to encode the private key. Both `public.key` file and `private.key` file are binaries.

In `example` folder you have an example for license template (input) and and its associated license (output).  

The content for `template.dat` can be (see example folder):
```
expirationDate=9/12/2020
companyName=HomeOffice
emailAddress=office@home.ro
```

In this case the content for `license.dat` (the license) is:
```
#License file
#Fri Feb 13 14:57:14 EET 2015
expirationDate=9/12/2020
companyName=HomeOffice
emailAddress=office@home.ro
signature=MCwCFBEzxwxCPSrWwYj1lsfyDDMKEhMmAhRtDi2klZeDojMK3HBF7xaC3OBj9A\=\=
```
Using Maven
-------------------
In your pom.xml you must define the dependencies to Licensius artifacts with:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>ro.fortsoft.licensius</groupId>
    <artifactId>licensius</artifactId>
    <version>${licensius.version}</version>
</dependency>    
```

where ${licensius.version} is the last licensius version.

You may want to check for the latest released version using [Maven Search](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Clicensius)

How to build
-------------------
Requirements: 
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) 
- JDK 7 (test with `java -version`)
- [Apache Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/) (test with `mvn -version`)

Steps:
- create a local clone of this repository (with `git clone https://github.com/decebals/licensius.git`)
- go to project's folder (with `cd licensius`) 
- build the artifacts (with `mvn clean package` or `mvn clean install`)

After above steps a folder _licensius/target_ is created and all goodies are in that folder.

Versioning
------------
Licensius will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
